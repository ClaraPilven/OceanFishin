# Ocean Fishin'

A Dalamud plugin for FFXIV

This repository is for development! 
If you want to use this plugin, you should install it via the in-game plugin manager.

`/oceanfishin` opens a window to suggest baits while ocean fishing. 

You also can use `/oceanfishing` or just `/bait`.

While in the ocean fishing duty, this plugin suggests bait to use...
* to catch fish that may trigger the spectral current.
* when you have the Fisher's Intuition buff.
* during the spectral current for fish worth a lot of points.
* for certain types of achievement and mission fish.
* to catch the exceptionally rare spectral intuition fish.

Bait suggestions are based on data from [Zeke's Ocean Fishing Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17A_IIlSO0wWmn8I3-mrH6JRok0ZIxiNFaDH2MhN63cI/ "Google Sheets"),
[S’yahn Tia's Ocean Fishing Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brCfvmSdYl7RcY9lkgm_ds8uaFqq7qaxOOz-5BfHuuk/ "Google Sheets"), and the Fisherman’s Horizon Discord server.

## How to Use This Plugin

1. Install the plugin via Dalamud's in-game plugin installer.
2. Join the Ocean Fishing duty. 
3. Use the command /bait in chat.
4. The plugin will automatically determine your location and recommend baits for that area and time.

The starting bait recommendation is the best chance for triggering the spectral current. 
The Fisher's Intuition recommendation is the bait you need to catch special fish when you have the buff.
The spectral current recommendation will provide the highest amount of points during a spectral current. 

*These recommendatations based on statistics gathered over many fishing sessions; Nothing is a guaranteed catch!*
