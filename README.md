# Ocean Fishin'

A Dalamud plugin for FFXIV

`/oceanfishin` opens a window to suggest baits while ocean fishing. 

You also can use `/oceanfishing` or just `/bait`.

While in the ocean fishing duty, this plugin suggests bait to use...
* to catch fish that may trigger the spectral current.
* when you have the Fisher's Intuition buff.
* during the spectral current for fish worth a lot of points.
* for certain types of achievement and mission fish.
* to catch the exceptionally rare spectral intuition fish.

Bait suggestions are based on data from [Zeke's Ocean Fishing Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17A_IIlSO0wWmn8I3-mrH6JRok0ZIxiNFaDH2MhN63cI/ "Google Sheets"),
[S’yahn Tia's Ocean Fishing Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brCfvmSdYl7RcY9lkgm_ds8uaFqq7qaxOOz-5BfHuuk/ "Google Sheets"), and the Fisherman’s Horizon Discord server.
