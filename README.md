# Ocean Fishin'

A Dalamud plugin for FFXIV

`/oceanfishin` opens a window to suggest baits while ocean fishing. 

You also can use `/oceanfishing` or `/bait`.

Suggests bait to use while in the ocean fishing duty:
* Bait to use to catch fish that may trigger the spectral current
* Bait to use when you have the Fisher's Intuition buff
* Bait to use to catch certain types of achievement and mission fish
* Bait to use to catch the exceptionally rare spectral intuition fish

The bait suggestions are based on data from [Zeke's Ocean Fishing Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17A_IIlSO0wWmn8I3-mrH6JRok0ZIxiNFaDH2MhN63cI/ "Google Sheets") and
[S’yahn Tia's Ocean Fishing Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brCfvmSdYl7RcY9lkgm_ds8uaFqq7qaxOOz-5BfHuuk/ "Google Sheets")
